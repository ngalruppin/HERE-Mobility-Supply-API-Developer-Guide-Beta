# HERE Supply API Workflow #

## Dispatch Callback: Respond to a Passenger Request to Book a Ride ##

Your supply-side application must implement a *CreateRide* callback function. The HERE Mobility Marketplace calls this function when a client-side application has requested to book a specific ride, triggered by a passenger request. Your application is responsible for booking the ride with the supplier who made the offer.

*To handle a request to book a ride:*

1. The Marketplace calls **CreateRide**, and your application handles the call. 
1. Your application books the call with the relevant supplier.
